Appearance and Reality  
 A man and his wife traveled to the zoo. They found a monkey that played passionately with his female. His wife told him: "What a romance." Then they found a lion and his lioness separated from each other; the lion was silent and alone in his corner as if the lioness did not exist. His wife told him: "What a sad scene without love." Her husband then told her: "throw that stone at the lioness and watch." When she threw it down, the lion leaped roaring to defend his lioness. 
      They saw the monkey again and she did the same by throwing a stone; the monkey then jumped and abandoned his female to save his hide. Her husband tells her later: "Do not be fooled by what you see as romanticism in some, many times it is a deceptive appearance that hides an empty heart; there are others on the contrary who do not show anything, but their hearts are full of sincere love " Unfortunately, today we have so many monkeys, and so few lions."
